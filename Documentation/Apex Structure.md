# Structure of Apex Language

Apex uses classes to define code to be executed. Like any other language Apex also consists of programming elements like

1. Variable Declaration - Variables are declared with a name and a data type
2. Statements (assignments, declarations)
3. Control Structures (branching) - If (If, If-Else, Nested If-Else), Do-While, While, For etc
4. Collections - Lists, Maps, Sets
5. DMLs and SOQLs for data
6. Exception handling using Try-Catch & Custom 

Salesforce also provides out of the box classes which you can use in the Apex. Apex is strongly typed so we need to define the data type and return types.
